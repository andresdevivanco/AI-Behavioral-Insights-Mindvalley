# 🧠 AI Behavioral Insights Project
**An open-source initiative to explore AI-driven content personalization on platforms like Mindvalley using automation, data analysis, and machine learning.**

---

## 📚 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze how AI algorithms personalize content recommendations for users on platforms like Mindvalley. By automating interactions and analyzing data, we aim to uncover patterns in how recommendations are tailored based on user behavior.

### Why This Project?
Understanding the inner workings of AI recommendation systems is vital for transparency, user empowerment, and ethical AI development. This project will give insights into how digital platforms use AI to influence user engagement and learning.

### 📚 Project Overview
We are developing an open-source system to analyze how AI platforms like Mindvalley personalize content for users. By simulating user interactions and analyzing the resulting data, we aim to uncover patterns in AI-driven recommendations.

### 🧠 Why We Need You
To build realistic user simulations, we need expertise from multiple fields:
1. **Psychologists & Behavioral Scientists**: Help us design user personas based on psychological research.
2. **Data Scientists & ML Engineers**: Analyze user behavior data and train models to predict AI adaptations.
3. **Developers**: Assist with automation scripts, data pipelines, and orchestration tools.

### 🛠 Current Needs
- **Psychology Experts**: Design profiles using the Big Five personality traits.
- **Data Engineers**: Set up databases to store interaction data.
- **Developers**: Automate data collection using Playwright (TypeScript).
