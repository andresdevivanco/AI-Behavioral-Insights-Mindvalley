I mean, it sounds like the right approach but it has a vital flaw: I can only monitor how AI applies to myself and not others 
ChatGPT Plus
ChatGPT
You're absolutely correct in identifying that limitation. Observing how AI algorithms adapt content for your own user profile only reveals a single point of data. It doesn't give you insight into how the system personalizes for a diverse range of users with different behaviors, interests, or learning paths. However, there are some potential workarounds and strategies to gain a broader understanding:

Strategies for Expanding Your Scope of Analysis
Creating Multiple Profiles:

If possible, set up multiple user profiles on Mindvalley (if the platform allows). By simulating different types of users (e.g., one focused on wellness, another on productivity), you can observe how recommendations and AI-driven experiences differ. This approach can help you see how the system tailors content based on varying interests and interactions.
Crowdsourced Observations:

Engage with the Mindvalley user community, especially in tech-focused groups. By discussing experiences with other users, you can gather insights on how different types of content or recommendations are presented to others. This can help build a more complete picture of how the AI is functioning across a broader user base.
Participating in Community-Led Research:

Some platforms or online communities are dedicated to reverse engineering and understanding how proprietary algorithms work. If Mindvalley‚Äôs terms of service allow it, you could collaborate with others to collect anonymized data on how the app's recommendations change over time based on different usage patterns.
Analyzing Publicly Available Data or Testimonials:

Mindvalley users often share their experiences in reviews, blog posts, or social media. You can analyze these accounts to identify patterns in how the platform‚Äôs AI personalizes content. While not as direct as accessing internal data, this qualitative research can be insightful.
Focusing on Mindvalley's AI Mastery Program and Summits:

Given your interest in the technical side, Mindvalley's AI Mastery program may delve deeper into the algorithms behind their personalization engines. This could provide you with a broader, behind-the-scenes understanding of how they leverage AI across their platform.
Exploring AI Research Papers and Patents:

Sometimes companies like Mindvalley publish papers or file patents detailing their technologies. While these may not disclose all operational details, they can provide insights into the theoretical frameworks and AI models they‚Äôre likely using.
Would you like to explore any of these strategies in detail, or need guidance on a specific technical area?

  const browser: Browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: true });
  const page: Page = await browser.newPage();

  // Navigate to Mindvalley's login page
  await page.goto('https://www.mindvalley.com/login');

  // Log in (Replace 'your_email' and 'your_password' with your credentials)
  await page.fill('#email', 'your_email@example.com');
  await page.fill('#password', 'your_password');
  await page.click('#login-button');

  // Wait for navigation after login
  await page.waitForNavigation();

  console.log('Logged in successfully!');

  // Extract recommended courses
  const recommendations = await page.locator('.course-title').allTextContents();
  console.log('Recommendations:', recommendations);

  // Simulate user interactions
  await page.click('.some-course-selector');
  await page.waitForTimeout(2000); // Wait for content to load
  console.log('Interacted with a course.');

  await browser.close();
}

main().catch(console.error);
Explanation of the Script
